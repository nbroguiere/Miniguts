Loss of Cdkn2a ends up similar to loss of p53. p16 binds to Cdk4/6, prevents Rb phosphorylation, which leaves Rb associated with E2f1, preventing E2f1-mediated transcription, necessary for G1/S transition. arf in p14arf stands for alternative read frame. Made upon abnormal mitogenic stress, like aberrant Myc or Rac signaling. In mice, p19arf is the equivalent. p14 inhibits mdm2, loss of p14 leads to elevated mdm2, which induces p53 loss of function.

Genecards: Essential for tight junction integrity. Also involved in transepithelial migration of leukocytes through adhesive interactions with JAML a transmembrane protein of the plasma membrane of leukocytes. The interaction between both receptors also mediates the activation of gamma-delta T-cells, a subpopulation of T-cells residing in epithelia and involved in tissue homeostasis and repair. Upon epithelial CXADR-binding, JAML induces downstream cell signaling events in gamma-delta T-cells through PI3-kinase and MAP kinases. It results in proliferation and production of cytokines and growth factors by T-cells that in turn stimulate epithelial tissues repair. "
